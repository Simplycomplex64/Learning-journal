            <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student</h1>
            <p>This is the day when i decided to join the scrimba community 09/03/2024, and if you ask me, i do not regret anything.
                this was one of my best life choices. I have learned a lot and soon i will have the job i have been looking for.
                A job that complements my lifestyle and Scrimba made it possible for me. Before Scrimba i used to say : it was impossible but now
                with the knowledge i got from Scrimba i can see it now. It's no longer impossible but the words been screaming at me all along
                IM POSSIBLE i just could not hear or see it.

                            I have learned the very basics of HTML and CSS so i can start creating layouts, and style them how i want.
                            I also had a solo project to test my knowledge and it was about our hometown. Very fun project. I learned a lot.

        <h1>Making websites interactive</h1>
        <p> I've learned to combine my newly acquired HTML & CSS skills with Javascript. This allowed me to create interactive websites.
            Then we had a solo project called : we are the champions. Once again it was very fun.
